# dio-bootcamp-gft-designpatterns

In this project, we have a simple example of the observer pattern where subscribers can receive updates about soccer matches.
We have two concrete observer classes to exemplify, the JournalistObserver and a TeamSupporterObserver.
The main method creates a instance of each of them and subscribe to the newsletter to show the pattern working.
